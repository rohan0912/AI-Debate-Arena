## ü§ñ Overview

AI Debate Arena is an Express.js API that facilitates multi-turn debates between four leading AI language models:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **DeepSeek**
- **Grok** (xAI)

Each model responds to a given topic and builds upon previous arguments, creating a dynamic exchange of perspectives that showcases the unique reasoning capabilities of each AI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-model debates**: Seamlessly orchestrates conversations between four different AI models
- **Sequential responses**: Each AI responds to previous arguments, creating a coherent debate flow
- **Topic flexibility**: Works with any debate topic provided by users
- **Error resilience**: Continues debates even if one model fails to respond
- **API-based**: Easy to integrate into web applications or other services

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- API keys for all AI services:
  - OpenAI API key
  - Anthropic API key
  - DeepSeek API key
  - Grok API key

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Debate-Arena.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

### Frontend Setup

The project includes a Next.js frontend for a complete user experience:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies (note: use legacy peer deps due to package compatibility):
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   
   If you encounter issues, try:
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

3. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to access the AI Debate Arena interface.

```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

Based on testing with 10-15 requests, here's the cost breakdown for each AI model:

| Model | Total Cost | Average Cost | Monthly Projection |
|-------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Claude (Anthropic) | $0.05 | ~$0.0033 per request | <$0.01 USD |
| ChatGPT (OpenAI) | $0.0362 | ~$0.0024 per request | ~$0.0362 |
| Deepseek | <$0.01 | ~$0.0009 per request | Varies by usage |
| Grok (xAI) | $0.06 | ~$0.004 per request | Varies by usage |

> **Note**: Actual costs may vary based on model versions, response lengths, and pricing changes by providers.


## üîß Customization

You can customize debate parameters by modifying the model handler functions in `app.js`:

- Adjust `max_tokens` to control response length
- Change system prompts to alter debate style
- Modify model versions as new ones become available

## üîí Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely and never commit them to your repository
- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent API cost overruns
- Add authentication for production deployments
